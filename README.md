# An electronic Van der Pol/Duffing oscillator

## Overview
This repository contains files for the realization of an electronic Van der Pol/Duffing oscillator, i.e., a circuit whose behavior is governed the equation

$\qquad m\ddot{x}(t) + (\mu x^2(t)+c)\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) + k_3 x^3(t) = f_{ext}(t),$
    
with $m>0$ and $k_3\geq0$.

The circuit takes a signal proportional to $f_{ext}$ and the parameters $c$ and $\mu$ as input and outputs signals proportional to $x$ and $\dot{x}$. It allows for tunable values of the parameters $k$ and $k_3$ via the use of potentiometers. It is also possible to chose positive or negative values for $k$ and obtain a single- or double-well oscillator, respectively.

The circuit requires an external power source with symmetric supplies. The input and output signals can be imposed/measured with BNC connectors.
